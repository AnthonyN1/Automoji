# Automoji
## About
Automoji is an open-source Discord bot that's in its early stages of development! Automoji will come with a variety of commands that Discord users can call, either in DMs or in a server! To invite Automoji to your Discord server, click on [this](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=764554242362441738&permissions=93248&scope=bot) link!

If you find this project cool/interesting/exciting, please leave a :star: on this repository! I would greatly appreciate it.

## Features
* ```User emojis```: personalize your messages with a custom emoji that you choose
* ...and more soon to come!

## Usage (link)
You can get Automoji on your server through [this](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=764554242362441738&permissions=93248&scope=bot) link!

Automoji will need the following permissions:
* View Channels
* Send Messages
* Manage Messages
* Embed Links
* Read Message History
* Add Reactions

If you choose to deny Automoji some or all permissions, please note that some commands will not behave as expected.

## Usage (self-hosted)
If you wish to host Automoji on your own machine (or using a cloud service), you can clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/AnthonyN1/Automoji.git
```
Automoji uses Python 3.8.5. See ```requirements.txt``` for a list of Python dependencies Automoji uses.

Visit the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) to create an application and bot. Use the bot's token to set an environment variable named ```TOKEN```. Additionally, Automoji requires you to enable the Server Members Intent, under Privileged Gateway Intents. See above for a list of required bot permissions.

Once everything is set up, simply run ```python3 main.py``` or equivalent in your terminal.
